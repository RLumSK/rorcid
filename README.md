`rorcid` is an R programmatic interface to the Orcid public API. `rorcid` is not a product developed or distributed by ORCIDÂ®.

rorcid docs: <https://docs.ropensci.org/rorcid/>

Orcid API docs:

* Public API docs: <https://members.orcid.org/api>
* Swagger docs: https://pub.orcid.org/v3.0/#/Development_Public_API_v3.0

The package now works with the `v3.0` ORCID API. It's too complicated to allow users to work with different versions of the API, so it's hard-coded to `v3.0`.

## Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate with `rorcid`:

- Use a token as a result of a OAuth authentication process. The token
is a alphanumeric UUID, e.g. `dc0a6b6b-b4d4-4276-bc89-78c1e9ede56e`. You
can get this token by running `orcid_auth()`, then storing that key
(the uuid alone, not the "Bearer " part) either as en environment
variable called `ORCID_TOKEN` in your `.Renviron` file in your home directory,
or as an R option in your `.Rprofile` file (called `orcid_token`).
See `?Startup` for more information.
Either an environment variable or R option work. If we don't find
either we do the next option.
- Interactively login with OAuth. We use a client id and client secret 
key to ping ORCID.org; at which point you log in with your username/password; 
then we get back a token (same as the above option). We don't know your 
username or password, only the token that we get back. We cache that 
token locally in a hidden file in whatever working directory you're in. 
If you delete that file, or run the code from a new working directory, 
then we re-authorize.

We recommend the former option. That is, get a token and store it as an
environment variable.

If both options above fail, we proceed without using authentication.
ORCID does not require authentication at this point, but may in the future -
this prepares you for when that happens :)

See <https://members.orcid.org/api/oauth/orcid-scopes> for more about ORCID 
OAuth Scopes.

## Computing environments without browsers

One pitfall is when you are using `rorcid` on a server, and you're ssh'ed
in, so that there's no way to open a browser to do the OAuth browser
flow. Similarly for any other situation in which a browser can not be
opened. In this case, run `orcid_auth()` on another machine in which you do
have the ability to open a browser, then collect the info that's ouptput
from `orcid_auth()` and store it as an environment variable (see above).
