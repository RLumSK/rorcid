R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.3 and
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Windows
R 3.2.3 and devel on Win-Builder.

This submission requires newest httr version, as older ones break
some functionality in this package - and update tidy data.frame printing.

Thanks!
Scott Chamberlain
